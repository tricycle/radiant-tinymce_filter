  <p>TinyMCE allows you to enter text into Radiant using a basic WYSIWYG view
  (What You See Is What You Get) much like you would find in Microsoft Word or
  other word processing software. To start writing, simply click in the white
  area underneath the toolbar and start typing.</p>
  
  <p>Like Microsoft Word and many other word processors, special functions
  are accessed by using the toolbar. To find out the purpose of an icon in the
  TinyMCE toolbar, simply hover your mouse over that icon and a small tool-tip
  will appear explaining it's basic function.</p>
  
   <div class="important"> <h3>Writing for the web</h3>
  
     <p>Writing for the web is a little different than writing using a regular
     word processor. In a traditional word document, every word, no matter how
     big or small, is really just text dressed up a little differently. Text
     on web pages is a bit different than that because all text on the page
     actually has an underlying "meaning" to it. That meaning must be
     addressed if your web page is to look and behave as it should.</p>
     
     <p>To put it another way &#8230; in a word document, you might know that
     a heading is a heading because it is larger than the surrounding text and
     it is a different color. That is, it <strong>means</strong> something
     different from regular text because it <strong>looks</strong> different
     (meaning is inferred from appearance).</p>
     
      <p>In a web page, a heading must actually be <em>designated</em> as a
     heading element, and once designated thusly, that text automatically
     takes on the size and coloring inherent to a heading element. That is, it
     <strong>looks</strong> different from regular text because it
     <strong>actually is different</strong> (appearance is inferred from
     meaning).</p>
     
      <p>So what does all this mean for you? When you are creating and editing
     pages make sure that if a section of text is supposed to be a paragraph
     that you actually format the section as a paragraph. The same thing goes
     for heading on a page, etc. Formatting text is easy &#8230; simply
     highlight the text you want to change and select a "Format" or "Style" to
     apply to it.</p>
     
      <p>You will find "generic" text types under the "Format" menu. These
     text types correspond to the basic types of text &#8230; paragraphs,
     headings, etc.</p>
     
      <p>You will find "special-case" text types under the "Styles" menu.
     These special cases are used to modify the basic values of text found
     under the "Format" menu. These styles are typically set by your web
     designer so as to maintain a consistent look and feel across your
     website.</p>
     
      <p>While writing this way can take some getting used to, it really is a
     much better way to think about writing. After all, it's not just people
     with good vision sitting in front of a desktop computer that access your
     website. People with physical disabilities (blindness), people browsing
     using their cell phones, and even search engines all expect that
     different "types" of text are actually marked up as being different. For
     these users, how a thing "looks" is completely meaningless. The only way
     to ensure that these users can properly understand the meaning of your
     text no matter what kind of browser they are using is by formatting
     special types of text using the "Format" and "Styles" toolbar
     functions.</p>

    <h3>Editor Tips</h3>
    
    <p>Sometimes you may see a special icon in the editor window.ï¿¼This icon is
    there to tell you that a section of special CMS code is needed on this
    page to make the page work properly. You should never delete or modify
    this code (or the accompanying icon) from a page unless you know what you
    are doing! </p>
